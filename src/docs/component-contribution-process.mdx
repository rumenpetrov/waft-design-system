# Component contribution process
The contents of the Design System must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components need to meet certain criteria.

### 1. Contribution criteria
To be successful, proposals need to show that the component being suggested would be useful and unique.

<table style={{ width: '100%' }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Criteria</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Useful</strong></td>
      <td>
        <p>There is evidence that this component would be useful for many users.</p>
        <p>Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Unique</strong></td>
      <td>
        <p>It does not replicate something already in the Design System.</p>
        <p>If it’s intended to replace an existing component, there is evidence to show that it’s better than the existing version.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Contribution criteria checklist
Start by opening an issue which should include information about the following points.

* [ ] Component description
* [ ] Potential use case examples
* [ ] Visual appearance
    * Set of requirements in text form
    * (optional) Design
* [ ] List of supported states - e.g. hover, focus, error, disabled, read-only...
* [ ] Expected interface/properties/variants/types/forms
* [ ] (optional) Responsiveness and adaptability - e.g. Expected breakpoints, resize behavior...
* [ ] (optional) Other useful resources

### 2. Criteria confirmation
Admins review proposals to check they meet these criteria. Confirmed proposals are eligible for starting the development process.

### 3. Development
New branch is created from "main" and pull request is opened when the code is ready for review.

#### Development checklist
* [ ] The component itself and any other related logic
* [ ] Provide stories which describe the component in details - e.g. states, interface, variants, examples...
* [ ] Documentation page updates, if applicable

### 4. Component confirmation
Admin review the code and request more changes or approve the component.
Approved components goes to the "Labs" section for some time until admins make sure everything is working as expected.
Admins decide when to move them to the "Components" section.
