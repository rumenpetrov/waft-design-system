# Design principles

The primary objectives of Waft are to:
* Simplify user interaction, making it easier to navigate and make informed choices without feeling overwhelmed by an excess of options.
* Preserving the native behavior and enhancing the visual aesthetics of the host platform's elements while staying true to the original vision.
* Leverage the modern APIs to provide smooth user experience.

## Typography
Typography creates purposeful texture, guiding users to read and understand the hierarchy of information.

* Our system is using 400 (Regular) and 700 (Bold) font-weight and It requires a font which supports at least these two options.

## Color
The design system should mostly blend with the page. Use color sparingly, only to bring attention to something.

* There is only one accent/primary/brand color per theme
* Light and dark colors are used for the foreground and the background
* System state use one distinct color each
  * Success - green gamut
  * Error - red gamut
  * Warning - yellow gamut
  * Info - blue gamut

## Iconography
Our intention is to use primary text symbols. You could use emojis. 🔗📐🖌🗑👌🙂

## Animations

Use light transitions to change the different states of a component. Prefer subtle and smooth easing curves.
