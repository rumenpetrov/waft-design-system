# Styling Web components
While Waft isn't designed for extensive customization, but it does offer a degree of styling flexibility to accommodate user preferences.
You could change the appearance of a component by overwriting the CSS custom properties it exposes.

```css
.my-custom-button {
  --wds-button--padding-x: 16px;
}
```
