# Labs Introduction

Here you could find components that are not yet ready to be part of the verified component list. You could look at these as WIP or not confirmed components. They might be missing features and are probably incomplete. After admins decide these components are stable, provide sufficient options and work as expected they are moved to the actual Components section.
