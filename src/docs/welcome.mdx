# Waft Design System
Waft is a non intrusive design system, build with simplicity in mind. It prioritizes minimalism, Web standards, using modern technologies and preserving the strong points of the platform it is running on.

Web implementation of the design system is created as native [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) so it can be used within every type of web frameworks.

## Principles

#### Minimal
Only the most essential things. Endless options and variants are not the thing we are aiming for.

#### Respect the platform
Slightly elevate the host platform while keeping the original vision (Enhance native)

#### Modern
Use the latest technologies.
